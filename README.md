This Python script generates a visual risk matrix for evaluating various risks based on their impact and probability. It uses matplotlib for plotting and provides a clear, color-coded severity level indication.

## Features

- Maps out risks on a 2D matrix based on their impact (severity) and probability (likelihood).
- Uses unique icons to represent different risks for easy identification.
- Applies color-coding to distinguish between low, medium, and high severity levels.

## Requirements

- Python (or python 3)
- matplotlib

## Installation

Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed on your system.
